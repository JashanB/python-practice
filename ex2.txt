   HIRING TEAM 
  BUNCH
 TORONTO, ONTARIO
  Dear 
Bunch
 Hiring Team,
   IÕm writing to you today in regards to the 
Junior Full Stack Developer
 position posted on
 LinkedIn
. I am a 
recent graduate of the Lighthouse Labs web development bootcamp, and am 
seeking opportunities as a Full Stack Developer. During my time at Lighthouse I developed a 
passion for 
creating interactive UIs in React
, and am very 
interested in continuing to work 
within this ecosystem at a supportive and creative company like
 Bunch
.  A recent project I worked on, BetterTrip, is a travel planner that allows you to search locations 
and add them to your calendar itinerary.
 This application 
utilizes
 5 d
ifferent APIs and acts as 
a one
-stop shop for 
travelers
. Built with a React front
-end and Ruby on Rails back
-end, I 
believe it highlights both my skills and abilities. I have also recently complete
d 20 javascript 
katas on CodeWars, made a ConwayÕs Game of Life React
-Redux app, and built a full
-stack 
Weather Ap
p with React and Ruby on Rails. My l
atest proje
ct, a React number guesser, was 
built as a means to practice integration and unit testing.
  As a junior in this field I am very motivated to continue to learn new concepts, programming 
languages, and fr
ameworks
. With a background in medicine, I have excellent reasoning and 
problem solving skil
ls, and am a highly collaborative individual who thrives in a team 
environment. I'm readily available via phone or email, and am eager for a future conversation 
where I could expand on my experience and why I would make an excellent addition to the 
Bunch
 tea
m. 
  Thank you so much for your time!
  Sincerely, 
  Jashan Brar
